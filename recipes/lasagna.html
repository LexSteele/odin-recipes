    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.</p>
    </b>
    <p>I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
